# The Great Ball

## The Soft story of Fred Ricchard 
One day Fred walked to the park to find his lucky red ball. He searched and searched but couldnt find it anywhere, He decided to check the grocery store. He searched all over the grocery store. Behind the milk, the staff lockers, even the bathroom, but Fred couldnt find it, so he decided to go home. While walking home he spots it in a random parking lot. He ran over to get it when he sees a creature watching him, he started running faster. Next thing Fred knew he was being chased by two human dog crossbreeds. But then Fred got cornered by another 9 crossbreeds. Fred thought it was over but then two soilders came out of a near by building and shot the crossbreeds to save Fred. Fred was so happy and thanked the soilders, he then walked home. As he was walking, he noticed another ball bouncing across the street. He then noticed a girl running after it down the hill.
