## The Soft story of Fred Ricchard 
One day Fred walked to the park to find his ball. He searched and searched but couldnt find it anywhere, He decided to check the grocery store. He searched all over the grocery store behind the milk, the staff lockers, even the bathroom, but Fred couldnt find it, so he decided to go home. While walking home he spots it in a random parking lot. He ran over to get it when he sees a creatur watching him, he started running faster. Next thing Fred knew he was being chassed two human dog crossbreeds were chassing him, while he ran home with the ball. Fred thought it was the end but out of no where two soilders shot the crossbreeds and saved Fred, he was relevied as he walked the rest of the way home.
